    "## Handling Loop Animation On Swipe\n",
    "\n",
    "From what we have so far above, you'd notice that when we start swiping, our loop animation is still repeating, this is because we are using the `withRepeat` function to repeat the animation. The preffered behaviour would be to stop the animation altogether when the user starts swiping and then start it again when the user stops swiping. We can do this by setting the `repeatTranslate` shared value to **0** in the `onActive` callback and then calling the `doRepeat` worklet function in the `onFinish` callback.\n",

And when the swipe gesture is finished, both the accept text and decline text would fade in. We can achieve this in two ways, either interpolating on the `swipe` shared value or creating a shared value `textOpacity` which we can the animate to 0 in the `onStart` callback, and animate to 1 in the `onFinish` callback.

    "# Refactor, Refactor, Refactor...\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as a bonus tip, we can refactor our code to make it more readable and maintainable using custom hooks and also moving some of our `jsx` into custom components. I wouldn't be touching on the latter, rather I would just provide a snippet on the custom hook part, you can find the refactored code in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BalogunofAfrica/rn-material-you-animations/tree/main/app/screens/IncomingCall \"Source Code\").\n",
    "\n",
    "I have moved all the logic for animations into a custom hook called `useIncomingCallAnimation`. This hook takes two arguments, a callback for the accept action, and a callback for the reject action, then it returns all our animated styles and props, and gesture handler just as we have used them above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this hook in `IncomingCall.tsx` component, we can now write the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```typescript\n",
    "...\n",
    "function IncomingCall() {\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    const {\n",
    "        acceptOpacity,\n",
    "        declineOpacity,\n",
    "        gestureContainerStyle,\n",
    "        gestureHandler,\n",
    "        headingStyle,\n",
    "        iconProps,\n",
    "        repeatTranslateStyle,\n",
    "        rotationStyle,\n",
    "        swipeStyle,\n",
    "    } = useIncomingCallAnimation(\n",
    "        () => console.log(\"Accepting call\"),\n",
    "        () => console.log(\"Rejecting call\"),\n",
    "    );\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
